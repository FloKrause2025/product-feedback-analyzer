Extra cool if I then could select topics that I like,Feature Request,Desire for an app version of the workflow with notification popups and customizable topic selection for news updates.
Reddit,Yeah that's what I was going to check out. The workflow and video are actually legit btw. My expectations were low but the workflow and documentation were on point.,Positive Feedback,
Reddit,"I see. 

What about a guide/instructional on creating the actual RSS feeds? It seems quite difficult, actually, compared to programming AI to search and scrub the web.

Reddit,"This is a really good list. And I completely agree with all points. Can I get it in poster format 😅♥️?

If I should add an 11th point, it should be learn a bit of basic javascript:
It will help immensely on understanding and debugging {{ }}-expressions. Specially JSON.stringify() helps manage that output from LLMs that may have special characters and linebreaks.
Many simple things can be handled via expressions without adding a code node. Code nodes are awesome, but they do launch a  javascript instance which do eat up some memory. (Also recommended in official docs about memory problems).",Feature Request,Requesting a poster format for the list and suggesting the inclusion of basic JavaScript learning for better understanding and debugging of expressions.
Reddit,"This is super helpful. Thanks for sharing!  
Totally agree on starting simple. I also spent way too much time on big workflows when I should have just built something quick to learn.

Reddit,"I've been at this for about 3-4 months and n8n is one of the most frustrating experiences around. I can build an app in Python and Flask incorporating LLMs in a few hours. A simple 5-node workflow involving OPENAI or Anthropic is a nightmare just getting the damn configuration to accept a prompt.  

There has never been one YouTube workflow download that works out of the box. It's always like pulling teeth to get around a troublesome node.

Reddit,"Is it just me, or are there no human checkpoints in this process?

I actually like n8n a lot. But from a marketing perspective, pushing out content at scale without real personalization is a quick way to lose trust.

I say this as someone with over 18 years in product marketing, currently working at an AI company in a director role. This pattern is familiar. When content is not tailored to the audience, engagement drops. AI can support content creation, but it still needs to reflect the brand’s voice. That usually requires human review, for now. 

There is already research showing that generic AI content performs poorly. I will try to find the piece I read last week and share it here.

Also, I want to be clear. I respect the work you put into this. This is not a negative comment. I just think it is an important conversation to have.",Negative Feedback,"Concerns about the lack of human checkpoints in AI-generated content, which may lead to a loss of trust and poor engagement due to lack of personalization."

Reddit,"May need to do a fully separate video for this, but in short we actually wrote code and spun up an API endpoint to handle this process. 

The n8n workflow makes an HTTP Post request to this endpoint on our backend, and then our backend takes that data and and uses the Sanity SDK (javascript library) to actually publish the content.

Hopefully there's a sanity n8n node that exists in the future, so we can rip this part out.",Feature Request,Request for a Sanity n8n node to simplify integration with the Sanity SDK.

Reddit,"I’d honestly prefer to write code before building a monster like this.

Honest question here, how do you organize your multiple workflows across different projects? Let’s say you have a 3 projects with 5 workflows each? Do you rely on naming conventions?

I started trying to split multiple “workflows” within the same canvas but n8n is not built for that so i’m facing limitations.",Struggle / Confusion,Facing limitations in organizing multiple workflows across different projects due to n8n not being built for splitting workflows within the same canvas.
Reddit,"When I see these giant canvases, I can’t help but think how shitty the platform is that most of this can’t be consolidated (more code and fewer nodes) and how frustrated i would be trying to build any of it knowing I could complete something similar in less than 50 lines of Python",Negative Feedback,"Frustration with the platform's inability to consolidate workflows, leading to complex and cumbersome node setups compared to more straightforward coding options."
Reddit,"The fact that you can run a workflow as a chainable tool, it's awesome and will make people think more modular, we just need to feel like connecting higher level blocks. Think about building a full Lego piece, from piece to segment from segments to the full piece, the latter I don't see very well n8n here.

Btw last workflow tool I mastered was Apache NiFi (with agents connected to master) and I feel in the future with n8n, I don't imagine what they're planning about chaining and wiring more for AI, you see things like langgraph for multi agents and supervisor and you can start connecting faster some dots... I hope they are smart and move in a good direction.

So far it is good, I have a swagger doc and want to make a custom connector but I don't want to code it, I wonder how good these models are given a swagger and given a good connector as an example to replicate it... I guess I have to test this or has anyone tried?

So follow the message op is trying to convey, think modular.

Reddit,"I'm a noodle still. I am stuck trying to get my vision out of my head and in operation. I get close then it fails. 

How many API's are you guys investing in. I was looking at Apollo for scrapping. Getting started I want to reduce excessive spending as much as possible until concept is proven and ready for production. I appreciate post like these as it confirms my thoughts. 

I tried to use Cursor for assistance and it does create a functional workflow but it comes with a lot of nodes. It never uses the AI tools node. It loves to use a multitude of nodes. 

It started to make sense. Using wait nodes and other debugging nodes to ensure it works. 

I like it simple and not full of redundant nodes.",Struggle / Confusion,The user is struggling to translate their vision into a functional workflow and is confused by the excessive use of nodes and complexity in their setups.
Reddit,"I made this mistake as well. I created a workflow to generate content, make it ready for an import into Magento2. And added a new functionality, added new features and I just startedt to ask myself, what if it breaks. Or what if I am sick or gone and somebody else has to work with it.

And than I realized, the features should all be separate flows. If I want one tool to combine them, I could use a form and trigger other workflows. But those overcomplicated workflows just cause issues.

I think there are some IT principles that everyone should keep in mind, especially single responsibility.",Negative Feedback,Overcomplicated workflows in n8n cause issues such as data drops and confusion.
Reddit,People saw that some people were selling these for lots of money and other people started jumping on the bandwagon. In all honesty…to buy an n8n workflow is the dumbest thing ever. Even if you aren’t a builder. Half of the workflows that people try to push right now will be out of date with another LLM update. The next half after the next update and so on and so on. The LLMs are coming out with more connections and more ways to integrate that…I don’t want to say that n8n workflows are useless because they absolutely are not. But….they are definitely are overhyped.,Negative Feedback,Concerns about the value and relevance of purchased n8n workflows due to frequent updates and changes in integrations.
Reddit,"I agree , btw these workflows became famous after AI area even if they are not AI related. In the end AI just made solutions like n8n becoming useful but people don't understand what you need is :

Reddit,Yeah the new functionality they just added simplifies it but a lot of times I just split things up pre-n8n and just trigger multiple webhooks where possible rather then relying on n8n to do all the routing.,Struggle / Confusion,Difficulty with routing in n8n; user often splits things up and uses multiple webhooks instead.
Reddit,Yeh simplicity and maintainability trumps cool shit! Without having to navigate to 10 different sub workflows to identify what is going wrong where - it is most times better to keep in one sheet - but don’t start with sub workflows - simplicity does not always look like 10 nodes in a workflow,Struggle / Confusion,"Experiences confusion and challenges with managing workflows, especially the complexity from navigating multiple sub workflows."
Reddit,"Sheets scale fine for most n8n use cases if you're using them correctly. I like baserow as I can self host it and the nodes are very easy to use.


If you're already a sql god then of course sheets is irrelevant. Most people gravitating to n8n would not be that level though which is why sheets is a good option for them!


Even myself I tend to write Python scripts for most automation, I only use n8n because it's genuinely faster to put together and explain to my non-technical manager but for anything more complex than basic stuff I wouldn't use n8n.",Negative Feedback,"n8n is not suitable for complex automation tasks, leading to reliance on other tools like Python for more advanced needs."

\* downloading templates directly hurts the original metrics. Imagine, if everyone will start downloading templates from \*your\* website, how would anyone know what's trending? u/n8n has implemented some metrics on their website, so I'd strongly suggest not to interfere with them.

Reddit,"I work at n8n and just want to call out that the first “insight” is already kind of BS (about not having error handling):
- Any workflow in n8n can trigger an error workflow. This is set in the workflow’s settings.
- You do need an error trigger in that error workflow, but I know many many users that have 1x fallback error workflow for their entire instance (and each workflow is set to use that flow as error flow). 
- A template when being imported naturally doesn’t import that workflow setting, since it needs to specify a workflow that already exists on your instance.

I did not read the other insights, but saw many comments here about “oh no they’re no prod ready” and it’s due to false AI assumptions from Claude.

As we’re growing, we’re seeing lots of people jump on the bandwagon and share insights. Perhaps there’s some valuable things in OP thread, but when very first thing is totally wrong… it’s hard to trust.

Reddit,This is impressive. But I'm surprised how much code blocks there are - couldn't the agent handle that with the right prompting?,Feature Request,"The user believes that the chatbot could handle more functionality without the need for code blocks, suggesting improvements in prompting capabilities."
Reddit,"It takes between 20 to 45 seconds depending on which path the message takes through the workflow. The longest response time comes from the booking agent path since it needs to make 4 different API calls, including the quoting API which alone takes about 10 seconds. I initially had Mem0Tool for memory management, but it was adding significant overhead, so I'm considering removing it since the PostgreSQL storage works well enough.

Response times occasionally exceeded a minute initially. I managed to dramatically improve this by hosting Supabase locally - some vector queries that were inexplicably slow are now lightning fast. In the end I don’t need it to answer too fast, it wouldn’t feel natural anyway. 

The main bottlenecks I had to solve were:


1. Message batching: Rather than implementing an artificial delay, I leverage the natural processing time (20+ seconds) to my advantage. Just before sending a response, the system checks if any new messages arrived during processing. This prevents duplicate responses when users send multiple consecutive messages without adding extra wait time.

2. Accurate data extraction: Getting reliable booking information (number of adults/children, precise check-in/checkout dates) was challenging. I had to use a specialized extraction agent with careful prompt engineering.

3. Date format interpretation: One surprising challenge was getting the LLM to consistently understand availability dates. Simply feeding ISO dates (yyyy-MM-dd to yyyy-MM-dd) produced inconsistent results. I had to find a more robust format with explicit natural language explanations of each date range. This would probably be less of an issue with a reasoning model, but GPT-4o struggles with it.

4. Context management: n8n's built-in memory nodes proved inadequate for a complex multi-agent system. They created a mess of message attribution - human messages would get processed by one agent, then fed to the next AI node which would incorrectly flag them as AI messages (and vice versa). This created duplicate entries and conversation history chaos. I solved this by implementing my own PostgreSQL-based chat history system with proper chronological ordering. This gives each agent a clean, accurate view of the conversation history without any attribution problems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Struggle / Confusion,"n8n's built-in memory nodes are inadequate for complex multi-agent systems, causing issues with message attribution and conversation history."

Reddit,"Yep. The reason you have to install the repo manually on your VPS is because the Mem0 MCP server doesn’t support npx yet.

With some other MCPs, you can just run them with a single npx command. But Mem0’s hasn’t been pushed to npm, so there’s no shortcut. You’ve gotta clone the repo and run it yourself on a server or VPS.

Reddit,"You need to learn to ask the right questions that solve problems for the Business Owner.

Too many n8n automation builders are focused on flashy workflows that look good in YouTube thumbnails but solve nothing in the real world. The truth is most of the money being made with AI right now comes from automating boring / repetitive business tasks. Business owners aren’t looking to automate LinkedIn acquisition, generate content or automate voice calls. They want practical and time-saving solutions that actually move the needle in their operations.

For example many business owners waste tons of time chasing invoices to be paid. Build a workflow that periodically checks their accounting software if the customer has paid, if not then draft an email with AI and chase those late payments.

Another complex task that costs business owners anually a lot of money is mismanagement of inventory. Build an AI workflow that scans low inventory and automatically drafts an email or PO to supplier. Notify wharehouse manager and track everything in a central dashboard. Use AI for smart insights based on historical data to improve stock purchases.

I can come up with 20 new ideas but hopefully this gets you inspired to see where the real money is at. Not in those shitty n8n workflows you see 16 year olds selling you on tiktok or instagram. Btw.. most of these kids show fake earnings with a vibe-coded website.

Reddit,"In case it is useful to have examples of real world problems that business have  here’s my brain dump of my top 7 pain points right now. My business is real estate development and asset management. 

1. Manual process in my accounting department. We pay for some expensive off the shelf tools to OCR invoices that I am sure could be done better and cheaper. My worry: we pay to develop something and then we can’t maintain it. 

2. Contract management. The Zoho CRM mail merge to Zoho sign is just a little too clunky. 

3. Related to the above, there is no easy way to track changes to clauses 
Across contracts. If we do a building with 200 sales contracts and 50 buyers negotiate exceptions to standard provisions  it gets very hard to keep track of those. Zoho has some tool for this but it is clunky and deficient. 

4. Keeping marketing content on brand. We have some custom GPTs for this but the better solution would be stringing a few together into a coherent work flow. 

5. Back to accounting, my team has to fill out tax forms online monthly. It’s a terribly manual process of downloading accounting information, manipulating it in excel and then cutting and pasting it into the government browser based reporting system. 

6. Project updates. I need to write investor updates regularly. Basically, I’m pulling info from a bunch of different sources (emails, CRM, excels, coda.io project manager database) and writing a memo in a specific format and tone of voice. 

7.  Financial models. This is a huge one. Not easy to crack.

Figure out this first",Struggle / Confusion,"The user's business partners lack knowledge about n8n, AI, and automation, creating challenges in convincing them of the benefits in terms of efficiency and cost-saving."
Reddit,"Haha yeah, that’s the thing — unless you know the right person, or randomly meet them at a bar or something, it’s not easy to just “reach in” and talk to the guy who knows what’s really going on in a company. Every place has that one person — maybe a manager, supervisor, or someone unofficially handling the tech side — and figuring out who that is can be half the battle.

Now, to give you a better picture — we’re in the transportation and logistics space. And from the outside, you might think it’s just trucks picking up and dropping off loads. But once you’re in it, the chaos behind the scenes becomes clear.

For example, one of our biggest challenges is tracking what happens to each load after it’s dispatched. Did the broker cancel it? Was it delivered? Did we get a proof of delivery? Was it paid, or is it still pending? When you’ve got just a couple of trucks, you can stay on top of that manually. But when you’ve got 50+ trucks, it’s a daily mess. Every day there’s a load that gets cancelled, a delay, a payment issue — and all of this has to be tracked correctly or things fall apart.

We’ve tried automating parts of the workflow, but it’s risky. Let’s say the system wrongly marks a load as paid — now you’re thinking it’s all good, but later realize the broker never actually sent the money. That kind of mistake creates more problems than it solves. So even though automation sounds easy, there are a lot of edge cases in real life.

And a lot of it depends on what software you’re using. We work with Google tools like Drive and Gmail, which luckily have APIs — so that helps. But other platforms we use don’t have official APIs at all, which makes automation a pain. I’ve even been building a Python bot to handle around 80% of the workload, but it’s still a work-in-progress.

Sure, there are other platforms with fancy APIs and AI integrations that could solve a lot of this, but they cost 200%-300% more than what we currently pay.

Reddit,"I've seen this over and over again for all sorts of niches online. n8n is hot because people see it as a vector to make money rather than for the quality of the tool itself (that is actually the real moat here). The make money online niche will move on from n8n, and already did so many times before (it was Zapier, then Make, now n8n, and there will be something else in 1-2y).

My 2cents:

* I love Nick and Nate. I found Nate when he had 5k followers. They're great instructors, and I definitely suggest following them. But please, please, remember they **do not make money building n8n flows**. They're becoming multi-millionaires because of their communities, not because their agency is particularly good at building flows
* The flows Nick & Nate build are not production flows, and **never account for real-world scenarios**. They're, as you said, workflow porn. They look great on a thumbnail, bring views and clicks into their communities, and make them grow the YT channel. The scope & goal of such flows is to grow their following, they're not designed to actually work and be debug-ready
* **You will not make 200k/m building automations right now, and that's a-ok**. I come from Italy, where the average salary is below 2k per month. In most of the world, the avg salary is below 3k per month. That's $18/h (gross). My mentality has always been: **can this skill make me $25/h? If so, it's worth learning**. $25/h working from home on your own schedule is a dream for many, and I was lucky enough to understand this early and ride all trends, become a respected self-employed person in my country and for US clients, and now make a very good income. The answer is a resounding **yes**, you can definitely make $25/h and way more working in AI & Automation. Is it 200k/m? No, but it's more than any company around me would pay, and more than I'd ever make in a physical office. **Focus on making more than you could otherwise, not on the shiny multi-millionaire salaries**
* **Get clients. $100, 200, 300 clients. Break things. Learn stuff**. Watching YT videos is not gonna get you the clients. Getting clients is rarely a factor of knowing more than others, it's about a smooth process that actually solves a business problem. I built 100s of content generation flows at this point in dozens of automation tools. Every single time I get a request from a client it's slightly different from the previous. My value is in recognizing their issue, unblock them with automation, and become a trusted assistant. I'm not selling ""n8n flows"". n8n is irrelevant, even automation itself is irrelevant. I'm selling the fact they can trust me to come up with ways to save them time and money regardless of who they are and what they look for.

Granted, I'm mostly a marketer that transitions to AI automations in the last 2-3y. So my opinion is a bit skewed. But hopefully it helps since I'm also pretty new to n8n itself.",Negative Feedback,"There is a concern that the perception of n8n is based more on its potential to make money rather than the quality of the tool itself, and that many workflows created for promotion do not account for real-world applications."

Reddit,"I'm a Software dev. Been using N8N for just over a year. I view N8N as a scheduler with a built in code execution and API integrations. It's great for that. 


The fact you can run AI models is a benefit but I don't think that's it's main purpose. It's being used in YT tutorials for AI because it can technically allow no code inference but in reality you're building code just visually, which is great for learners but once you get going it can be limiting. It's basically Scratch with a scheduler + more bells and whistles.  I also think YT tutorials people like this because they themselves don't really know how to code. Otherwise Python can handle everything N8N does with more granularity and that's what they should be teaching.


I'm using it for my scheduled task needs at work. I host a dockerised n8n in Azure. Mainly it's scanning DBs for rows with a certain status or broken name based on our internal naming convention and kicking off a certain task such as renaming in our private hosted LLM via API calls or whatever else based on that status. Used to be in a Quartz scheduled job in a Spring app that was a nightmare to maintain as the app did a lot more than that and other changes would regularly break the scheduled jobs. N8N allows me to make tiny work flows and have them running independently and also much quicker than requesting the resources needed for a standalone app to do that task.

 Pro's:
- easy to setup and beginner friendly.

- great for small businesses and low traffic applications.
- great for building out mvp's fast.
- great for testing hypothesis fast.

Con's:
- a lot of technical bottlenecks (open source version)
- hosted enterprise version is too damn expensive.
- somewhat limited in case of specialized scenarios 
- security is bad don't put it on the internet without proper security measures 
- high traffic = high costs
- pain in the *ss to debug workflows if you don't pay for it. 

So what do i do here on the n8n fan page? We'll I like the tool, it's great to build simple mvp's for clients to get them hooked on the real stuff. Once the client is happy and knows that what he is paying for is worth it, i build out the real application that is production worthy. 

So be aware of the limitations, don't over promise. Test with the client first. Because face it, the AI hype is real, and they want to put it everywhere. Even where it doesn't make sense.

Reddit,"There is IMHO an even bigger time bomb 💣 lurking under the N8N surface - Community Nodes.

What is the issue…
No doubt community nodes bring a ton of value and benefits to N8N.
BUT… there is no validation/security process for them.
Meaning, you are building with a lot of unknowns.
Unknowns that will break your work flows if a given developer of a node you use stop updating the node.

And this is already happening for many community nodes.

You don’t get any warning of faulty node dependencies if you install it via the N8N UI - but installing nodes via terminal on your own N8N you see the problem with some 60% of nodes (this is how I came to see the problem).

Now, many of the warnings you get about faulty dependencies may not cause the node to crash or mis anything vital- YET.

But I foresee an escalation in breaking workflows the same way Wordpress plugins tend to need constant maintenance- building your own automation infrastructure or client infrastructure using solo-dev community nodes is asking asking for trouble and potentially lawsuits from clients.

Sure… building with free “LEGOs” is a fast and profitable way to get into automation.
But until we have a rigorous process for screening homebrew nodes - it’s simply a matter of time before the proverbial sh.t hits the fan.

For now… install nodes via terminal to know if you are playing with fire and should look for a better node for the task.

Or think about building on a paid platform that has a vested interest and financial incentive in making sure your nodes don’t break going forward.

Reddit,"Any time, buddy! Here are some additional recommendations:

- Error handling: Specially for deployed live solutions, think how you are gonna handle errors, and I don't mean n8n fully crashing and not working, I mean errors caused by the work flow not getting the data it needs, not sending that email it was supposed to send, not inserting that record it was supposed to insert. Yes, you can always check n8n logs but for certain cases you want to know about errors happening exactly the moment they happen and not until your client complains to you about the tool failing since 3 days ago. You might want to build your own notification email with very specific details for you, specially if you are dealing with money-related operations.

- Use Edit Fields node: Yes, the beauty of n8n is that you can drag and drop the outputs of previous executed nodes and use them in the next nodes, sometimes you might need to use the output of a specific node multiple times across your work flow, or maybe multiple values from multiple nodes multiple times, and if for whatever reason you need to change one of those initial nodes (specially when you are still building) good luck finding all the places where you used those nodes output. Instead, learn when to throw in an Edit Fields in your work flow to store those values, and reference that node in your future nodes, that way it doesn't matter if you change all the nodes that come before your Edit Fields, the rest of your work flow won't be affected, and you just need to worry about making sure your Edit Fields receive the data it needs for the rest of the work flow to continue working. 

- Expiration of tokens, credentials, etc: Once you launch something live, there will be cases where the credentials you use expire after X amount of days/months (specially in corporate), make sure you always keep track of that, your work flows will fail the moment credentials fail.

- Build MVPs and demos fast: Once you feel comfortable and ready to try to sell, build solutions fast to test the market and offer your solution, don't try to cover every possible scenario until you win the deal, don't spend more time than what is actually needed, you don't know if you are gonna get the deal. And by fast I don't mean build them in 2 nights, just don't take 3 months. Again, this once you feel ready to start trying to sell. In the meantime, yes, take your time, learn as much as you can because once you sell something shit gets real and you have to deliver yes or yes.

- (Sales) Do not sell n8n or automation: Your clients unless they are technical they won't care shit about words like n8n or seeing workflows run in your computer, they care about solutions to their problems, sell that, sell a solution, if the problem is they can't handle client requests, build a demo that shows how their email or crm or whatever gets organized automatically the moment they receive an email. If their problem is they don't respond fast enough to their clients on WhatsApp, build a demo of an AI chatbot responding (use Telegram for demo purposes, their API is free). Always sell something they can relate to, they don't care about how things happen behind the scenes. Showcase your solutions using day to day tools. If you don't want to spend time building the automation the create slides, showcase your solution with screenshots, simulate the solution, just make sure whatever you present you can really build it.",Feature Request,"The user requests enhancements for error handling, token expiration management, and the importance of using Edit Fields in workflows to improve user experience and reliability in n8n."

Reddit,">n8n doesn’t track goals or adjust behavior automatically over time

Does anything track goals or adjust behavior automatically over time? This is kind of like saying that n8n doesn't track bananas over time. You kind of have to program whatever you want an agent to do and direct it to determine how it knows when it is done, when to consider when the goal can't be achieved or too many resources have been used to achieve the goal. I'm not sure how this is necessarily different than something like langchain, other than there might be better examples for implementing it in that particular framework.

  
I don't really see a use case that you have called out that I can't think of a way it could be done with n8n, except for the most critical limitation that n8n has. n8n cannot build a workflow of agents that streams structured data, which means there will be higher latency to start processing extracted data before the response is complete. For example, let's say that you want to parse PDF for named entities that has 1000 entities on it. You can't detect entity 1 and immediately send that off for some downstream process, like you could with langchain, mastra, etc. You have to wait for the entire node to complete before you process it, like storing the entities in a database or sending the entities to other agents to perform downstream research.",Negative Feedback,"n8n cannot build workflows of agents that stream structured data, leading to higher latency in processing, as it requires waiting for the entire node to complete before processing results."

you could also go with a rag pipeline but youll always need some evaluator thats gonna look at the feedback and update the vector db otherwise it wont really adapt by itself

the real problem with n8n is once the agent gives a result theres no real way to just re run it automatically and make it learn over and over its not like you can have this infinite loop where it keeps improving non stop",Negative Feedback,n8n lacks the capability for continuous autonomous learning and does not allow for automatic re-running of workflows to improve results over time without manual intervention.

A lot of the folk on the intertubes only know how to put a canvas together and be done with it. The advanced ones either build the nodes/tooling or move on to what you are talking about.

Reddit,"I partially agree with this. I come from a web development background having experience of running a marketing agency and taking it from 0 to 10mn ARR in merely 5years.

Here's my take on how these companies can't be given competition using n8n behind the scenes:

1. Latency: Latency is a huge problem when you have millions of concurrent users quering or processing things in parallel. No matter what you do, you can't replace a direct python code executing inside GPU in a multi-threaded environment, distributed across systems with n8n. Not at all. 
2. Scalability: as mentioned above as well. 
3. Good for tools not for heavy lifting systems: Where n8n as a workflow service for systems where users interact on Frontend and get their job done is good, it's not good where users require quick jobs and expect stuff to be done live in front of their eyes on the screen (we use graphql for such jobs 😉)
4. Control: If you replicate an n8n automation in python, you'll realise that you have more control to minute details in code compared to n8n.
5. Ease of use: While python coding is not everyone's cup of tea for production level corporate coding environments, n8n gives a visual ease to the processes. We feel amazed by looking at the process going through each step and checking execution logs and see the data flowing etc. But we don't realise it comes at a cost of latency as I mentioned earlier.

If you want to build production ready complex systems, don't rely on tools rather deep dive and solve for each stage like architecture, application, network etc etc.

Reddit,"Thanks! I could have coded it in python or something but honestly the flexibility of the node systems really helped. I started by building the show by hand, logging into websites/chatgpt and copy/pasting everything. After I had done that for a few days I took some of the more labor intensive parts of it and made a workflow for it. Originally, I started with 1 full workflow but now I'm a true believer in the sub-workflow process.

Identifying good tooling helps too. 

Creatomate was a gamechanger to build the video in a repeatable and standardized manner. Firecrawl made it easy to scrape the data needed.

Definitely some bumps along the way. The fact that loops cause full re-runs of flows was very annoying. I've taken to almost always having a Edit Fields node after so I can easily pin data, point the manual trigger to the Edit Field and cut out any previous loops. Core flaw of n8n in my mind.

Reddit,"Any loop causes all downstream nodes to regenerate when you test. So if you have a loop, then do some merging of the data and use that data, if you test a later step, it will re-run the entire loop for some reason. If you notice the loop doesn't have a ""pin"". Haven't dove into the code but I'd bet that's the reason.

I’m a competitive distance sled dog racer turned AI enthusiast, and I’ve found myself on a very personal journey. One that began with the simple goal of creating a memory aid for my elderly mother, who is facing the challenges of dementia.

 My mother has a treasure trove of over 1,600 letters, journals, and diaries that span decades. These writings are a goldmine of memories, thoughts, and reflections—her life in words. But as her condition progresses, it’s become harder for her to access those memories and use them as a source of comfort and clarity. I wanted to bring her those memories back, and I knew technology could help.

 That’s when I began working on a memory companion, a device that would serve as both a memory aid and a conversational partner, powered by AI. It would allow her to revisit her writings, receive prompts based on her past, and have meaningful conversations that reflect the memories she holds dear. The ultimate goal is for it to not just be a device, but a companion that can speak with her, encourage her, and offer a sense of grounding as she faces the effects of dementia.

But here’s where I need your help—I’m developing this project through automation with n8n. What do I need the n8n workflow to do? I need this workflow to tie together several crucial services and tools to create a seamless and supportive experience for my mother. Here’s what we’re looking to build:

 1.      Phone Integration (Twilio):

The workflow should allow my mother to interact with the system via phone. Using Twilio, the goal is for her to call in and verbally interact with the Memory Companion. It should transcribe her speech and use that input to pull relevant memories from her database of letters, journals, and diaries, and also allow her to ask questions or have simple conversations.

2.      Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text:

Once the system processes her request (whether it’s a memory, question, or conversation), it needs to respond in a soothing, human-like voice. Text-to-speech technology will play a critical role in making sure she feels heard and understood, while speech-to-text will allow her to communicate naturally.

3.      Memory Database Integration:

We have a huge collection of her journals and diaries that need to be scanned, indexed, and made accessible through this workflow. The goal is for the AI to understand context and reference these past writings when asked, offering a conversationally rich experience. Database management is key here—whether it’s a Google Sheet, Notion (which I was using already, or trying…) a custom repository, or a more advanced system—I need a workflow that can pull from this pool of data based on user input.

4.      Cloud Syncing & Storage:

Any new entries or updates need to be synced to a cloud storage system (Google Drive, etc. Currently building a Drive database and interested in the long term memory possibilities of Supabase.) for safekeeping and to ensure the data is always backed up. This could be a simple document or even journal entries my mom records directly into the system.

5.      Personalization:

Finally, the AI companion should feel personal and empathetic, adapting to her mood or needs based on her interactions. This could be as simple as shifting tone or providing comforting responses. N8n should help create those adaptive triggers based on predefined inputs, be it from phone interactions or stored data. It must also remember from day to day, the interactions with my mother, and have long term memory. 

Why this matters:

This workflow is crucial not just for improving her quality of life, but also to give me peace of mind knowing that, as her condition progresses, she still has access to a part of her past that grounds her—her own words. I want to create a system that helps bridge the gap between technology and memory, offering both support and comfort.

I’d love to hear your advice or even suggestions for existing templates I can adapt to this project. Every little bit of guidance helps, and I’m eager to make this memory aid a reality.

Thanks so much for reading and for any help you can provide!

Reddit,"I have seen YouTube videos on how to separate the workflows. My fear is that I will need a pretty good amount of overall workflows to accomplish everything (9 at minimum I think - Main workflow plus 8 additional for the various tools like email, drive, etc.)

Thats why I was trying to find a way to have either 1) Multiple AI Agents in the same workflow, or 2) See if using MCP nodes would work.

Because until I get it built and running properly, I don't want to upgrade my account. And right now I am limited to 5 workflows.

Reddit,"I'm still learning about it as well. But what I gather is that it is basically is a tool that encompasses multiple features in one versus having to have separate tools for the same account (i.e. Gmail - MCP can read, write, draft, delete, etc. Just from calling the Gmail server versus having to have separate nodes for each action in Gmail like my current layout does.",Struggle / Confusion,User is still learning and trying to understand how to effectively use n8n to simplify their workflow related to managing multiple accounts.
Reddit,"There should be an export button. You can also literally select all the nodes, copy, and then paste into a text editor like notepad.",Feature Request,There is a need for an export button in n8n to simplify the workflow export process.
Reddit,"Agreed. I tried to use AI Agents with output parser (because you need to ensure the AI sends you in a format that can be handled by the next node), but such a pain you know?

Reddit,"Looks pretty good, but I think it could use some tweaks to support leveraging it without having to modify the core implementation. For context, I was going to leverage this by launching it in portainer, which allows launching stacks from git repos, configuring through env variable overrides. As-is, i believe it would require me to make changes to docker-compose.yml and .env at the very least.

For example, there is no environment variable for:

* The volume mapping from a local directory to the container path for each application
* The port mapping from the host machine to the port within the docker network
* I think you want to avoid reading in the local .env file into the applications, so that you can specify the runtime env variables
* Really, any static value in the docker-compose file should be an env variable with a default value, and you can skip the .env file entirely, which is typically not uploaded to version control",Feature Request,"The docker-compose setup could be improved to allow variable configuration without modifying the core implementation, such as using environment variables for volume and port mappings."

Reddit,"👋 This looks pretty neat nice work, I do have 2 questions though…

why not add puppeteer to the n8n image instead of making a new image that may not have all the dependencies we include?

You mentioned our docs are terrible for queue mode, I kind of agree it isn’t easy to follow but have you created a github issue on the docs repo with your thoughts so we can make them better?",Struggle / Confusion,The documentation for queue mode is difficult to follow.

\- The sign-up flow is effortless, although I am used to authenticating with Google, so I was expecting that option.   
\- The side menu is well organized and easy to navigate. The 📈 icon in' popular' made me think I would find a chart or dashboard of he most popular ones. Maybe a star?   
\- Also, the home should be 'Discover'. As a user, I want to go to the 'explore' or 'discovery' option, but there isn't one, so I start clicking all the options to find it.   
\- I need more contrast of the text fields for the title and description in the share automation modal. I was just clicking randomly to find the fields.   
In the community view, I would like to see people's profiles or a list of their own automation.

Reddit,"**Thanks for the thoughtful feedback!** You're absolutely right—adding filters like company size would make the results far more targeted, especially for niche use cases.

As for private profiles, that’s definitely a limitation of relying on Google indexing. I’ve been thinking about combining this with tools like Apollo or Clearbit for enrichment and maybe even adding a LinkedIn Sales Navigator fallback.

And yes, company-specific queries are doable! You can input the company name directly in the search term (e.g., `CEO XYZ Law Firm site:linkedin.com/in`), but I’m planning to make that a separate input field in the next update for better control.

I know little about extensions, but if there is a way to either just have it stay up until I click the icon again or have it so that opening and closing it doesn't refresh to a blank textarea. ""+"" button could be the method to start the next chat.

  
Again, thank you, and I have no idea what these people are talking about with this being built in. As far as I know, it isn't. n8n is, by definition, the ""self hosted edition"". Anything else is something \*else\* - like a cloud offering by the same people.

Yes, you can build your own version of this in a workflow in n8n and then not need it, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a private company selling a service (AI workflows) that is built on top of the open source fair-code workflow automation platform. It happens the authors of those two different and distinct things are the same people.

I'm not trying to insinuate this is an OBS / SLOBS issue; most open source saas/paas/bass have a paid cloud offering with goodies; there's nothing wrong with it.

For example say I have a pet product for dogs etc:
- who owns a dog

- people in the industry of dogs and related 
- people who spend a lot on their dogs

I think getting super specific would be challenging due to the minimal information that scrapers can find

From what I'm seeing, this absolutely has product potential. One of the biggest barriers to automation adoption is the initial setup and workflow creation - your solution basically eliminates that by detecting patterns automatically. Super smart approach.

I've built tons of automation systems for clients across industries, and the ones that win are those that reduce friction in the workflow creation process. Your tool hits that sweet spot perfectly by removing the need to manually identify and create those workflows.

The use cases are massive too - customer service teams, data entry folks, even devs doing repetitive code commits. The ROI for businesses would be immediate - saving hours of work each week adds up fast.

If you guys decide to take this further, I'd focus on making the n8n workflow generation super reliable and maybe add some AI smarts to suggest optimizations to the detected patterns. Also, consider building a simple dashboard that shows users how much time they've saved.

Reddit,"I have 3 ideas


Firstly, I'd like a tweet performance analyser. So I already have it tweeting for me and the tweets saved in supabase - it would be cool if it went back to the tweet after a set period of time (e.g. 48 hours or a week) and fetched the likes, shares, number of comments etc and saved this in supabase so I can analyse what worked best. 


I'd also like an Upwork jobs searcher. So it listens for certain keywords in job descriptions and sends me an alert when a relevant job is posted. Or it fetches all the matching jobs every 15 mins or whatever - bonus points if it can apply for the job too, and upload relevant pdfs showcasing my work when it applies (I know this might be a bit tricky though) 


The last idea is a document creator. I store some written materials in supabase, e.g. for a business proposal, or an invoice or a CV , I would like n8n to pull various fields like headings, subheadings, body text and arrange them in a nicely formatted and professional looking pdf which is then saved somewhere so I can email it to people etc. exporting to a nicely formatted word or Google doc would also be useful ",Feature Request,"Request for a tweet performance analyser, an Upwork jobs searcher, and a document creator with specific functionalities."

However, when I pull these emails into a Google Sheet using Google Apps Script, the links end up unorganized, making it hard to actually read them later.

I’d love an automation that not only extracts these links but also organizes them better. Specifically:

Automatically categorize each link with 3  AI-generated tags (via ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

Display the links in a web app as a news feed, sorted by most recently added or by key tags 

Show each article's title (as a hyperlink), source domain (instead of full URL), first ~88 characters (like a sub-headline or partial content of the first paragraph), original publication date, and exactly three AI-generated tags. Supercool if the original or key graphic that goes with or illustrates the article is also displayed. In the absence of the original illustration, an alternate image created with Pexels API can be used to output an illustration for each article to make the feed more inviting to read.

Reddit,"Honestly, I think this n8n situation is partially becoming another fad. Like, don't get me wrong, the technology is incredible, but there are tons and tons of people there who have no idea about tech, business, or ""real world"" and are trying to automate it.

It's like becoming an Agile or Scrum consultant with little real-world experience.

And don't get me even started on the ""I can have 0 tech knowledge part."" Here's a sample: I heard from a professional grapevine that at one company in my field, an eager salesperson implemented an n8n flow to manage meeting slots and accounts. Submit form, select options, next page shows in dropdown client details. Cool, but I forgot to put auth to form before prod publish and leaked the whole client list online where the competitor picked it up. Can't tell exactly how they found prod URL, but they did and bye bye confidentiality.

I can also see a lack of coding skills and, in particular, coding mentality when I see flows that are several times longer and more complex than what they need to be.

N8N agencies will unlikely be a thing. There will be, but this will really just be adopted by existing business intelligence/ business development agencies. Serious companies, like my main clients, vets contractors, and agencies strictly and have skilled people to catch bullshitters.",Negative Feedback,"Concerns about the rise of users without technical expertise leading to poor implementations of n8n, resulting in security issues and overly complex workflows."
Reddit,"I understand your perspective and I share similar concerns. I believe that tools like n8n, make, and zapier should not be the only solutions we rely on. They need to be used alongside other tools, frameworks, or approaches, as applicable. Additionally, I'm concerned that n8n and make might eventually incorporate AI features, which would allow everyday users to create workflows using simple AI prompts. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it could be problematic for those running an automation agency if they have nothing more to offer in such a scenario.",Negative Feedback,Concerns that reliance on tools like n8n and the potential introduction of AI features could impact automation agencies negatively.
Reddit,"This is the correct answer.
 
I would consider calling yourself a consultant rather than an agency would be my thinking. The agency way would imply a different set of skills whereas calling yourself a consultant means you are experienced in delivering high level automation and seeing the weak points in a business that can be automated/agentic ai'd 

I have worked as a consultant building workflows taking data from multiple databases, merging and cleaning datasets then outputting as templated pdf or html emails - building the entire process from database design/integration with existing systems, through to the templating engine - this is what the clients paid for, not me dragging and dropping some nodes together.

Be careful not to pigeon hole your skill. n8n is great and I'm sure some people will make a lot of money quickly, but I bet they are the people that will tarnish the skills we have when their platforms aren't resilient and robust.",Negative Feedback,Concerns about the perception of skills and the potential for n8n users to not deliver resilient and robust solutions compared to more experienced consultants.

Reddit,"We’re running n8n at a similar scale - about 70 people total with 7 users who need n8n access. We haven’t found SSO to be necessary at this size. Regular authentication works fine for managing a small team of users.

I get the sticker shock at $50k for SSO licensing. While SSO is nice to have for bigger enterprises, I’d question whether it’s truly essential for a small/medium business running small-scale devops. The core automation capabilities are all there in the self-hosted version.

We’re running n8n with PostgreSQL and Docker and it handles our automation needs well. Unless you have specific compliance requirements mandating SSO, you might want to evaluate if the community edition could work for your team size. The automation capabilities and versatility you mentioned are all available without the enterprise license.

That said, if SSO is absolutely required for your use case, you could try negotiating with n8n’s sales team - sometimes there’s flexibility for SMBs.

Reddit,"Make:
Error handling in Make is limited to the module level, meaning you have to setup custom error handling for each module individually. When an error occurs in Make, the entire scenario stops processing - even during batch operations where only one item fails.

We handle errors at both the node and workflow levels in our n8n instance:

Node-Level:
We configure critical nodes with:
- 3 retry attempts with delays on failure
- Error output paths where needed, especially useful for batch processing since it allows the workflow to continue processing remaining items even if one fails

Workflow-Level:
We use a standardized error handling workflow for most of our workflows that:
1. Captures workflow errors
2. Records them in Notion
3. Checks Notion to identify who owns the workflow
4. Posts to our team Slack channel including:
   - Error details
   - Execution link
   - Tag for the responsible team member
   - Resolution buttons:
     - Fixed
     - False alarm 
     - Auto resolved

- Adds a retry button in Slack
- Uses the developer inspector data to interact with hidden API endpoints in our self-hosted instance
- Allows us to retry failed executions directly from Slack",Positive Feedback,"Error handling in n8n is superior, providing node-level and workflow-level error handling, which improves reliability and allows workflows to continue processing even if one item fails."

Reddit,"It's not so much a problem with n8n I find. It's more that you see a lot of YT videos using these things, but once you dive into them, they are actually very limited in use. For instance baserow, yes you can upload files etc. But you can't build queries in them. So in a way it becomes a glorified table viewer. So if you want the agent to use meaningful data, you have to prepare it offline just to upload it.

No offense to anyone who uses it, but it felt as if there is an element of ""Look, I did a thing"" (Jeremy Clarkson), when making the YT videos.

For the record, it's usually airtable, but similar issues there + you're trusting someone else with your data.",Negative Feedback,"n8n and similar tools like Baserow and Airtable are perceived as limited in functionality and require significant preparation of data offline, which affects usability."

Reddit,"It’s a great tool for quick automations and it’s very powerful for individuals and small teams.  However I feel like actual meaningful uses of companies depending on it for production will be very limited.  It basically just modularizes parts of backend code and allows you to chain them together.  

But the more AI advances.. why wouldn’t you just use AI to build actual systems with proper security, resiliency, availability, and scalability instead?  Most of this stuff isn’t magical.. it’s the same stuff developers have been building for years with code.  It’s just we actually think about all these other aspects when designing systems.

Reddit,"I work at a large agency, and I'm looking at adding n8n to our toolbox, as I personally love it. But honestly, n8n will probably only be used for prototyping proof of concept solutions before deciding the fate of an idea. For enterprise clients with an established tech stack, n8n just doesn't fit in, and i'd be worried about having it be part of crucial workflows. Also the enterprise licens is really what big clients need with control over credentials, single sign-on, collaboration, and source control. And the enterprise license is expensive. 

That being said, i think n8n fits better with small and medium sized companies based on SaaS products, so if you aim at working with that type of clients or agencies serving those customers, n8n could make sense to learn. But remember, it's a tool, not a skill. With the pace everything is moving right now, expect to be learning new tools and platforms all the time.",Negative Feedback,"Concerns about n8n's suitability for enterprise clients, specifically regarding its limitations for crucial workflows, the cost of the enterprise license, and the need for more robust features like credential control and collaboration."

With FlowMod I definitely would do less. I personally would like to see less and that done really well. I would focus on round trip engineering for a single platform including spinning up an n8n instance for debugging (is not rocket science) - would keep users on the platform.

Why do less? Because I think you will be able to do it better and migrations happen way less often than you think. The migration/translation can be an 'experimental' feature. I only recently started with n8n since I noticed 'lay' people doing great things with it. I would ride the traction.

Reddit,"Dude, this is actually super cool! 🔥 I've been experimenting with AI-generated workflows in n8n for a while now and it's insane how much time it saves.

Claude definitely has a good grasp on n8n's structure - I've found it understands JSON workflow structures really well. I built a similar workflow editor with AI assistance for my clients and it's been a game changer, especially for quick prototyping.



A few things I've noticed that might help your project:

\- Claude/GPT can get the basic node structure right, but sometimes misses on credential handling during imports between instances

\- The AI is great at generating the workflow skeleton but may need guidance on more complex node configurations

\- Prompting it to include proper error handling in workflows makes a huge difference



Having this directly in n8n would be absolutely killer. Imagine just typing ""I need a workflow that monitors my Gmail for specific emails and sends them to Slack with AI summaries"" and boom - instant workflow template ready for tweaking.

Reddit,"I have built an immensely useful pipeline that uses multiple “agents” by some definition of the term. 

In my experience, the smaller the task you ask of an AI, the better. I get better results breaking a workflow down into sub-flows with dedicated “agents” tailored for their task. 

I recently broke up a product generation workflow into ideation, generation, and review workflows with optional chaining. This allows me to better tune the prompts for each step and has absolutely improved the results. 

The new superpower is the ability to describe how you perform a given task, and break that into small enough pieces for an AI to handle while managimg the context provided to each. Or the ability to extract that information from others.",Positive Feedback,The user has successfully built an efficient workflow using multiple 'agents' and found that breaking tasks into smaller sub-flows improves results.
Reddit,"""Agents"" seems to be an overloaded phrase. The core thing I believe you're trying to talk about is orchestration. There are several ways to orchestrate workflows (agents being just nodes within the workflow):

LLM Orchestrator is basically using an LLM to handle everything with tool calling, handoffs, memory etc. Code Orchestrator, which is where n8n would lie, basically involves using a standard code to control the workflow eg through I/O chaining. 

I do believe each has its own specific use cases. Code based orchestration is extremely deterministic and is ideal for automating work that is always done a certain way that rarely changes and where reliability is extremely important, for example, invoice processing.  LLM Orchestrators work best for tasks that are flexible in execution and where there's not an exactly single reliable process to follow eg shopping on Amazon. In such cases, LLM orchestrators with instructions, tool calling and handoffs work best and code-based orchestrators would struggle as hell. The tradeoff being the loss of determinism and no guarantee you'll always get the same output given the same input",Negative Feedback,The term 'Agents' is considered overloaded and misleading in the context of n8n; it seems more appropriate to refer to the functionality as orchestration rather than multi-agent systems.
Reddit,"N8n is a lie your just writing langchain agent code. 

Dumb dumb

Ai is a lie it’s just an API call



Your perspective is yours.",Negative Feedback,"User feels that n8n is misleading, as it does not offer true multi-agent capabilities but rather just allows for basic API calls."
Reddit,"an agentic AI is just a fancy workflow with extra steps, it is not that different unless we understand agentic AI as the LLM is ALSO taking the decisions of when to move to one node or another, which most of the time adds unneeded delays and unintentional branching.",Negative Feedback,"The concept of multi-agent AI in n8n is misleading and does not match the expectations of a true autonomous collaborative system, leading to delays and unintentional branching."
Reddit,"The Google nodes in n8n use OAuth not service accounts, and Google OAuth for private apps expires every 7 days, so the client must have access to the instance to keep re-authorizing their system. For this reason, my advice is to setup a separate instance for each client prior to delivery, with an admin account that you can hand over to them (eg, under their email).

This was one of the main reasons I stopped using n8n for client setups - the lack of user permissions and the requirement that you keep re-authorizing google. The ideal solution is to setup a Google service account inside the client's Google workspace and then use that to interact with the Google APIs - it never gets logged out and can interact as any user in the workspace - but it's only available on work accounts.",Negative Feedback,The lack of user permissions and the requirement to keep re-authorizing Google OAuth for private apps is problematic for client setups.
Reddit,"This is a great question as I am going through this as well. 

I though of one solution, and let’s use your example, they will send an email to an address I control, then my n8n would do its thing as a trigger with that email. It could get a bit tough if you have hundreds of clients. 

So as far as scale goes, this could be an issue but the advantage is that if something breaks, you can fix it all at once for all your clients, or if you wanted to push more features, you can do it all at once. 

The other option I thought could work is to use easy no code platforms as front end. Caspio for example can do this and it has a login for your users, and your create everything like a CRM. You could even store their logins there without you ever seeing them. That comes with its own set of issues though. 

What makes me hesitant is that I wouldn’t want to give my clients a product that breaks (either by my set up or some connection just broke) and I have to go to all their instances to fix the flow. That doesn’t scale either. 

I am new to this, so Ya’ll that have more experience can have a much better guide to do this. 

In my perfect world, I would give users a front end so they can see whatever is they need to see. I would also feel better if I didn’t have to see their API keys but could call them in a flow.",Struggle / Confusion,"User is confused about the best way to deliver finished workflows to clients and manage accounts, credentials, and API keys in a scalable manner."
Reddit,"Okay you lost me here. Are you saying the OAuth Client ID and Secret password expire after 7 days?

Sorry, all new to me. I am self hosting and just coded my first agent that is working exceptionally well.",Struggle / Confusion,Confusion regarding the expiration of OAuth Client ID and Secret password.
Reddit,"When you setup a private OAuth app in Google they expire user permissions every 7 days, meaning your workflows stop working until your client logs back into n8n, goes to credentials, finds each google credential, and OAuth's them again (separately!). Obviously this is a non-starter with self-hosted n8n if the client has more than one employee, because they'll all need to share the one n8n admin account to login and setup their details.

The route around this is if you publish the Google OAuth app, which has various requirements, google may require you to provide a demo video, proof that you own all associated domains, public facing webpages and privacy policies, the works - and can take several weeks.

  
The fundamental problems are:  
\- Google w/ onerous OAuth publishing process

\- n8n w/ preventing you from having more than 1 user on community edition

  
Combine those two issues together and it made me realize n8n community edition is successfully crippled, so I inquired about the cost of being able to have multiple user accounts - $20k / year!",Negative Feedback,"The Google OAuth app has a cumbersome user permission expiration process that complicates workflows, and the n8n community edition restricts multiple user accounts, making it difficult for clients with multiple employees."
Reddit,"So that means n8n is doomed to fail?

Why would I wish to continue using n8n even under self-hosting if I have to keep renewing my permissions every 7 days?

Are you sure there are not other ways otherwise I may as well start looking for an alternative to n8n.",Negative Feedback,"Concern about having to renew permissions every 7 days under self-hosting, leading to doubts about the viability of using n8n."
Reddit,"You can go through the Google OAuth publishing process, which would extend your token validity times (idk how far, but a lot) - however, if you are trying to support multiple users, there will always be cases where they get de-authorized and the lack of multi-user support in community edition prevents them from being able to re-authorize without an admin to help them.

Another path if you're automating a google apps for work account is to setup a google service account with site-wide permissions - this is a bit scary for the client so you need to have good trust there (they'll be giving you all keys to the castle to make it happen) but then you have long term programmatic access to every user in the org's email, calendar, drive etc. However, I am not sure if this auth works with the Google nodes in n8n (I messed around with it a bit but didn't get it working there). I mostly use this auth with dedicated scripts in windmill.

My recommendation is that n8n community edition is good for personal use, but too hard to make work in a multi-user context.",Negative Feedback,"The lack of multi-user support in the n8n community edition makes it difficult to manage authorization for multiple users, which complicates the delivery of workflows to clients."

Reddit,**Why do I absolutely need a domain?**,Struggle / Confusion,The user is confused about the necessity of having a domain for using n8n.
Reddit,"Yes, but. 4 problems with that.   
  
1. You have to have your computer on if you run multiple timed sequences. If computer restarts or loses power for some reason, you need it backs your logs ups until you restart it and have to manually restart processes. Making cron tied processes a mess. 

2. You may need a more powerful system that one may or may not have or can afford, so a $5 a month fee makes sense than buying a $2000 computer. 

3. Use of memory on your local machine vs using the system for other tasks. Depending on the workflows you run, or whatever you use your computer for, it may create conflicts. 

4. Remote access. Unless you have your home server or computer on 24/7 with remote access, a VPS allows you to access the processes remotely wherever you are and whenever you want to. I do a lot of Human in the Loop workflows, which I can run through remotely when I get some free time.   
(Ex: if I am waiting for kids practices, I can use their Chromebooks to do QC on the VPS, solving my problem of being bored out of my mind and not having to have my home system on or brining my gargantuan laptop with me.

Reddit,">How would you use n8n (or any other automation tool) to blow this up?

I'm just going to assume your product works and critique your user's workflow.

You're going to lose most of your potential users, I'd estimate 90%, because your process is too many steps.  Users are too lazy and incompetent to save and load two images and click go.

You need smarter AI.  Your process should be user copy's and pastes a URL of something they want to buy or of something they want to ""try on"" for input 1, and and a ""take selfie"" button for input 2.

You'll need to scrape the page looking for a large image file to find the image of the clothing.

After you fix that, throw some adsense ads on it and monetize whatever traffic you do have, then use that as a marketing budget.  There is some great synergy here if your users have a higher likelihood of buying the product they are ""trying on"".  You don't have to figure that out, the algorithm will do it for you and get you better ad revenue because your traffic converts.

I think subscription is the wrong model.  People aren't going to pay for this, the conversion rate will be impossibly low.

I find it hard to agree with the people saying go B2B.  Frankly, you are not going to find and contact the right decision makers without a seasoned team of experts.

So simplify your process, get some early revenue, and figure out where you're getting the best traffic from.  Maybe you bundle your app into a browser extension, the ""tryit-and-buyit"" where retailers will pay you a hefty commission if your app pushes customers to buy.  Like the user is looking at a web page of a shirt they are thinking of buying, and your browers extension button shows them wearing it.

But if you are really asking for a self hosted open source platform that would blow this up or at least match what I assume you can do, it's probably some Stable Diffusion workflow that's connected to the web.",Feature Request,"The user suggests simplifying the workflow for the AI virtual mirror by allowing users to copy and paste a URL and take a selfie, instead of having to save and load images, indicating a need for more intuitive automation options within n8n."

It's absurd to me already that pro license is not available to self-hosted. Well. Not absurd. When it's on their cloud, they can access everyone's flows and train their AI further.

Reddit,"I believe that you have good intentions. Genuinely. It was a bit harsh to imply that what (can) happen would be intentional or ""scammy."" What I mean by bait and switch here is that a self-hosted instance will get limited to a degree that it will become unusable. As well as the rumours of super expensive commercial licenses will price out a lot of startups and independents.

But once the revenue starts evening out, there will be insane amount of pressure from investors to raise it. Your round B was modest, and the main investors seem legit, but I'm always sceptical of VC. Profit and YoY growth trumps all. So you have your work cut out for you for sure. I'm nowhere near as successful as yourself, but I've been in that room where investors/boards drop bombs that you know are about to rattle everything to the core.

I genuinely hope this doesn't happen. But it wouldn't be the first or last time that VC ruins a great thing just for short-term profits.

Re self hosted plans, we are testing around with 3 clients right now. Each one is self-hosting. None of these are like Fortune 500, but one of them is very large. So out of what I've seen, self-hosting is the preferred option for medium-large enterprises. I get the cloud stuff, and I can see how supporting that can be a bother, but I'm talking about like variables, sharing workflows, and now (allegedly) debugging is being locked down. Looking just at this community, a lot of users are self-hosting. As you get telemetrical data, I'm not sure if you're able to divulge. How many active users are self-hosting?

Locking down these basic features essentially means that medium-sized companies have trouble actually proving their use-cases. Locking down debug has made a lot of people nervous. And appearances matter.

Transparency is there. It's easy to find in your docs what's a sustainable license is and how it works. In great detail. But a loooot of community quite clearly doesn't understand that - a lot of people with non tech backgrounds don't really understand what software licensing is and how to differentiate. Is this your fault? Absolutely not. But does it place these users and their possible ventures in an extremely risky position? Yes. Is it their fault if shit hits the fan? Kind of.

At the end of the day, I get that you have to make a profit and give all the possible features that take a ton of money to develop for free. I'm a fan of making money as well.

So, as a takeaway, sorry for too harsh words, but I see a lot of risks for small operators and agencies here. It's a great project overall.",Negative Feedback,"Concerns about limiting features for self-hosted instances and the potential for high costs of commercial licenses, which may negatively impact small businesses and startups."
Reddit,"Enterprise customer here 👋
I have been procuring many enterprise solutions over the years and n8n pricing is quite balanced in my view. Active workflows is not ideal but it does allow for significant scaling without unmanageable cost increases that you see with per execution / cpu or similar usage based enterprise software.

Having said that, I wish there was one lower tier for self-hosted that allows for git and/or external secret features to be enabled.
As a founder of small startups as well… I now find that there is a transition phase (let’s say pre-seed / pre-profit for bootstrapped) where you want a secure, scalable, well versioned software pipeline and can pay ~$100 per month but don’t need / aren’t ready yet for full enterprise adoption / scaling. The n8n startup plan is very good but still steep for bootstrapped organisations.

I also feel there is some grey area around acting as an AI / Automation agency and using n8n to provide services for clients / manage their instance(s). As n8n use cases have shifted, perhaps it’s time to think about the best way to grow both the community, network of partners & advocates and corresponding enterprise lead pipeline for n8n?",Feature Request,"Desire for a lower tier plan for self-hosted n8n that includes git and/or external secret features, especially for startups in early stages."

Reddit,"No, it's not. But ""not being hidden"" is not same as ""being advertised"".

RIght now, the information about the startup plan is hosted off-site on notion. Also to actually view plans, user has to go to pricing page, scroll down, go to notion, and only from there back to [plans.n8n.io](http://plans.n8n.io) subdomain where they can actually sign up. General rules of conversion go that signup shouldn't be more than 3 clicks away from homepage.

I'm not saying this because ""it's hidden and that's bad"" - what I'm saying is that putting it like this, it's possible that startup owners are going to pricing page, checking out Google/Reddit for pricing and getting turned away by the high prices of enterprise not knowing there's an option for them.

Having the startup license info also on notion + subdomain is bad for SEO as well, it's diluting the domain authority. Searching ""n8n startup plan"" doesn't lead to explicit page where it's being advertised. For me, the 4th result is the first one that's not n8n owned and it's to a Reddit comment complaining about enterprise plan price.

To fix this, best thing to do is to scrap the [plans.n8n.io](http://plans.n8n.io), it's kind of redundant (design also looks a bit legacy) and add more clear stuff about startup plan to blog / create dedicated page instead of hosting at notion.

I think it's possible that n8n is losing some potential customers over this. They might then go for pro, which isn't perfect for them and not optimal sale for n8n.

Are you meaning to trigger a workflow to run without logging into n8n? Sure, that's possible however I wasn't talking about that in my post; I was saying there's no way to STOP an execution.

But to your point about starting an workflow, there's a couple of thoughts that come to mind:

\- Grafana can only link to a URL (in the current tab, or a new tab); it's can't execute the GET in the background so in terms of UX, it's not very good. Grafana does have a ""URL Action"" function where you can GET / PUT / POST to a URL in the background it simply doesn't save anything you configure it with and some quick searching revealed this appears to be a known issue.

\- If you want to be able to start a workflow from outside the n8n interface, any workflow you want to start will need a webhook trigger in addition to whatever other trigger (on schedule, etc) the workflow has.

I'm confused by your comment though because you said to use an ""execute workflow"" node... I'm not sure how that relates to anything; having an ""execute workflow"" node in a workflow is about executing another workflow from a workflow and if you wanted to execute workflows from outside of n8n, I think you'd just use a webhook trigger.",Struggle / Confusion,Confusion about stopping an execution in n8n and how triggering workflows relates to the use of an 'execute workflow' node.
Reddit,"You can not stop the execution of a workflow from outside on n8n. So you must log in, find the execution in the list and cancel it. This sucks because sometimes n8n / the whole server becomes unresponsive and if you're unable to stop the problem because you can't even log into n8n, then you have to restart the server and n8n picks up where it left off after restart.",Negative Feedback,"Cannot stop the execution of a workflow from outside n8n, leading to server unresponsiveness and requiring a restart to resolve issues."
Reddit,"Perhaps there's a limit on screen shots - it keeps removing my last pasted image. Oh well - it was showing the ""executions that get queued"" charts.",Bug Report,"There seems to be a limit on screen shots in n8n, as the last pasted image keeps getting removed."
Reddit,"Yes, thanks - I'm using filters already in the dropdowns at the top of the dashboard (workflow name, execution type, and execution duration). I'm also using transforms as much as possible to cut down on latency / load.

I'm quite impressed with Grafana.

Alerts - definitely need to do that.

Are there any community dashboards for n8n? I couldn't find any.",Feature Request,The user is looking for community dashboards for n8n but couldn't find any.
Reddit,"I hope there's a way to package and develop as a Docker container application that allows connection to n8n to view some basic information. Alternatively, we might have to wait for n8n to support a REST API protocol to get the necessary statistical information about the workflow.",Feature Request,Desire for a way to package n8n as a Docker container application and request for n8n to support a REST API protocol for accessing statistical information about the workflow.
Reddit,I'm happy to share when it's of use to others. I'd love to see what people want in a dashboard for n8n hence this post. All ideas / discussions welcome!,Feature Request,User wants to gather ideas and discuss features that others would like to see in a dashboard for n8n.
Reddit,"In my experience it was definitely not one click. I was doing a ton of things in the terminal to get it working. While pretty much a “set it and forget it” type of process, it definitely was not as easy as choosing n8n as OS. Also, if anyone reading this wants to go with Hetzner, be sure to install the PostgreSQL version (non-lite)- it will perform way better if you have big workflows.",Negative Feedback,"The installation process for n8n was not as straightforward as expected, requiring extensive terminal work."
Reddit,"Put the book text in a vector store. N8n integrates with Supabase, Qdrant, MongoDB, all offer vector storage.

Reddit,"With the Code node, you can do everything that Google Scripts can do and have a better developer / debugging experience.

Of course, you won't build something super robust and scalable on n8n, but you also wouldn't do that as a Google Script or a simple Python lambda function.

You can do coding on the level of complexity that you'd use Google Scripts for; without ever leaving n8n.",Positive Feedback,"Impressed by the capabilities of the Code node in n8n, especially for tasks similar to what Google Scripts can accomplish."
Reddit,You can write test way easier. Its a super +++,Positive Feedback,Writing tests in n8n is easy and beneficial.
Reddit,"I just want you to chip in and say that n8n is very stable and very capable of running stuff in production. I understand that many have a mindset that n8n allows for fast prototyping. But it is in fact stable enough for production.

My company is running n8n in production, as a platform for internal automation usages.

Our n8n runs many types of automation. Were using n8n to automate stuff like:
- many different ETLs from our datalake to our datawarehouse, some running daily, some running hourly. 
- many webhook triggers (ex. Sale register a user for a product in our crm, that calls a b8bn-webhook with a user-id, so the Webhook flow handles subscription attachment, newsletter signup etc. In other systems)
- Daily data cleanup flows to ensure high data quality 

And we are close to implementing an AI colleague in Slack, build in n8n. It detects the intent and executed subflows depending on the required task. Can be everything from QoL stuff for editors or support teams.

And I have some nice on/off boarding ideas for using the form nodes in n8n. Form nodes just got a nice makeover which could simplify a lot of internal manual HR processes.

We have a self hosted environment for test and staging and a clouded for production. Changes to our flows are automatically pushed to github, so we have version control on all flows. 

We have a Webhook recording events on mailflows, recording 100k+ of events pr hour in peakhours, with no problem. Super smooth and very stable for production usages.

N8n is great for a lot of things, that makes sense to run as no/low code. 

If you want to build an service that can handle many millions large data requests a day you probably want to build it with code and host it somewhere else. But even such a solution could be backed with some features that are handled via n8n.",Positive Feedback,
Reddit,"There should be no real difference. You can look at n8n as code with UI, rather than no-code.

Every code that run is basically a workflow. n8n and others (make, ..) give a user the options to view that workflow in a different way than the editor.",Feature Request,"The user suggests that n8n should enhance the way workflows are represented visually, providing a clearer connection between UI and code."
Reddit,I frankly didn't know you could export a workflow... I was doing it with copy and paste piece by piece until it was rebuilt. I'll try this!,Struggle / Confusion,"The user was unaware of the workflow export feature and was manually copying and pasting, indicating confusion about the product's capabilities."
Reddit,"Three dots > Download

Also, I’ve recently come to the exact same realization as you - it’s kinda perfect!

You can also upload or pasted in properly formatted json, to the canvas, to build workflows programmatically.

Reddit,"I’m maintaining a lot of different conversations but all tied to the same thing, so I use n8n to create Memory Hooks, where a hybrid ingestion setup of an Assistant and some utilities allow me to always push ultra context rich data into my long term memory. 

All of the Agents that are a part of this network have the same custom tool attached to them. This custom tool calls the n8n API endpoint and this is where the Agents submit all of their different chat history responses, and currently I manually control it via prompts and voice speech. 

I’m running personalized Agentics so there is a lot of stuff working together, and with n8n I can chisel those ultra targeted workflows that can then process things into the 3072 Large Pinecone Index.

Reddit,I had the same idea 2 days ago and have deepseek running on my local server. I wanted to make sure I wasn't overlooking something and had it create the Json.

Would love to hear if anyone had success.,Struggle / Confusion,User is unsure if the JSON generated by DeepSeek is valid for importing into n8n and is seeking confirmation on its success.
Reddit,I was playing with o3-mini today and asked it a workflow question and it output json that doesn't import. If you get this working that would be awesome! Would certainly save a lot of time if you could pump in the api documentation for an api that doesn't have a node and it would build out compatible http nodes for the task.,Feature Request,"Desires a solution that allows JSON output from an LLM (like o3-mini) to import correctly into n8n, and the ability to auto-generate compatible HTTP nodes using API documentation."
Reddit,"I'm no coder and not much experience in n8n functinality but what if you have your workflow connected to a customgpt by webhook/api and it could 'see' what it was creating, refine it in an iterative loop until desired functionality achieved and then when you told the customgpt a text prompt it altered the workflow in real time to take into account any improvements/changes to functioanlity

You could get it making any workflow then - I was always looking at getting the customgpt in conjunction browseruse or similar to create a database and portal for my business in the same way - ie with a prompt and let it go off and do it.
