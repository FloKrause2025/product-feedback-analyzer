Reddit,"This is a really good list. And I completely agree with all points. Can I get it in poster format 😅♥️?

If I should add an 11th point, it should be learn a bit of basic javascript:
It will help immensely on understanding and debugging {{ }}-expressions. Specially JSON.stringify() helps manage that output from LLMs that may have special characters and linebreaks.
Many simple things can be handled via expressions without adding a code node. Code nodes are awesome, but they do launch a  javascript instance which do eat up some memory. (Also recommended in official docs about memory problems).",Feature Request,Request for a poster format of the list; suggestion to include the importance of learning basic JavaScript for better understanding and debugging expressions.
Reddit,"This is super helpful. Thanks for sharing!  
Totally agree on starting simple. I also spent way too much time on big workflows when I should have just built something quick to learn.

Reddit,"I've been at this for about 3-4 months and n8n is one of the most frustrating experiences around. I can build an app in Python and Flask incorporating LLMs in a few hours. A simple 5-node workflow involving OPENAI or Anthropic is a nightmare just getting the damn configuration to accept a prompt.  

There has never been one YouTube workflow download that works out of the box. It's always like pulling teeth to get around a troublesome node.

Reddit,"I still use Make.com for some things! But I’m shifting more of my core builds to n8n because:

1. Self-hosting gives me more control over data and performance
2. Version control and modularity feel better for scaling more complex workflows

Reddit,"Is it just me, or are there no human checkpoints in this process?

I actually like n8n a lot. But from a marketing perspective, pushing out content at scale without real personalization is a quick way to lose trust.

I say this as someone with over 18 years in product marketing, currently working at an AI company in a director role. This pattern is familiar. When content is not tailored to the audience, engagement drops. AI can support content creation, but it still needs to reflect the brand’s voice. That usually requires human review, for now. 

There is already research showing that generic AI content performs poorly. I will try to find the piece I read last week and share it here.

Also, I want to be clear. I respect the work you put into this. This is not a negative comment. I just think it is an important conversation to have.",Negative Feedback,Content generated without human checkpoints risks losing trust and performing poorly in engagement.

Reddit,"May need to do a fully separate video for this, but in short we actually wrote code and spun up an API endpoint to handle this process. 

The n8n workflow makes an HTTP Post request to this endpoint on our backend, and then our backend takes that data and and uses the Sanity SDK (javascript library) to actually publish the content.

Hopefully there's a sanity n8n node that exists in the future, so we can rip this part out.",Feature Request,The user hopes for a Sanity n8n node to simplify their workflow by allowing them to remove the backend integration currently needed.
Reddit,"I totally agree. The text part is relatively fine, but the Dall E images are crap",Negative Feedback,The Dall E images generated are of poor quality.

Reddit,"I’d honestly prefer to write code before building a monster like this.

Honest question here, how do you organize your multiple workflows across different projects? Let’s say you have a 3 projects with 5 workflows each? Do you rely on naming conventions?

I started trying to split multiple “workflows” within the same canvas but n8n is not built for that so i’m facing limitations.",Struggle / Confusion,Facing limitations in organizing multiple workflows across different projects within n8n.
Reddit,"When I see these giant canvases, I can’t help but think how shitty the platform is that most of this can’t be consolidated (more code and fewer nodes) and how frustrated i would be trying to build any of it knowing I could complete something similar in less than 50 lines of Python",Negative Feedback,The platform's inability to consolidate workflows leads to frustration and inefficiency compared to simpler coding solutions like Python.
Reddit,"The fact that you can run a workflow as a chainable tool, it's awesome and will make people think more modular, we just need to feel like connecting higher level blocks. Think about building a full Lego piece, from piece to segment from segments to the full piece, the latter I don't see very well n8n here.

Btw last workflow tool I mastered was Apache NiFi (with agents connected to master) and I feel in the future with n8n, I don't imagine what they're planning about chaining and wiring more for AI, you see things like langgraph for multi agents and supervisor and you can start connecting faster some dots... I hope they are smart and move in a good direction.

So far it is good, I have a swagger doc and want to make a custom connector but I don't want to code it, I wonder how good these models are given a swagger and given a good connector as an example to replicate it... I guess I have to test this or has anyone tried?

So follow the message op is trying to convey, think modular. Document the whole thing to keep a way to understand the full picture, not only you, your agent as well ;)",Positive Feedback,User appreciates the modular approach of n8n and hopes for enhancements in connecting higher level blocks. They express a desire for better documentation and a user-friendly way to create custom connectors without extensive coding.
Reddit,"I'm a noodle still. I am stuck trying to get my vision out of my head and in operation. I get close then it fails. 

How many API's are you guys investing in. I was looking at Apollo for scrapping. Getting started I want to reduce excessive spending as much as possible until concept is proven and ready for production. I appreciate post like these as it confirms my thoughts. 

I tried to use Cursor for assistance and it does create a functional workflow but it comes with a lot of nodes. It never uses the AI tools node. It loves to use a multitude of nodes. 

It started to make sense. Using wait nodes and other debugging nodes to ensure it works. 

I like it simple and not full of redundant nodes.",Struggle / Confusion,The user is struggling to implement their vision into n8n workflows and finds it confusing due to excessive nodes and complexity.
Reddit,"I made this mistake as well. I created a workflow to generate content, make it ready for an import into Magento2. And added a new functionality, added new features and I just startedt to ask myself, what if it breaks. Or what if I am sick or gone and somebody else has to work with it.

And than I realized, the features should all be separate flows. If I want one tool to combine them, I could use a form and trigger other workflows. But those overcomplicated workflows just cause issues.

I think there are some IT principles that everyone should keep in mind, especially single responsibility.",Negative Feedback,"Overcomplicated workflows cause issues, leading to concerns about data drops and processing times."
Reddit,People saw that some people were selling these for lots of money and other people started jumping on the bandwagon. In all honesty…to buy an n8n workflow is the dumbest thing ever. Even if you aren’t a builder. Half of the workflows that people try to push right now will be out of date with another LLM update. The next half after the next update and so on and so on. The LLMs are coming out with more connections and more ways to integrate that…I don’t want to say that n8n workflows are useless because they absolutely are not. But….they are definitely are overhyped.,Negative Feedback,"n8n workflows are perceived as overhyped and potentially outdated due to frequent updates in LLMs, leading to concerns about their value."
Reddit,"I agree , btw these workflows became famous after AI area even if they are not AI related. In the end AI just made solutions like n8n becoming useful but people don't understand what you need is :

Reddit,Yeh simplicity and maintainability trumps cool shit! Without having to navigate to 10 different sub workflows to identify what is going wrong where - it is most times better to keep in one sheet - but don’t start with sub workflows - simplicity does not always look like 10 nodes in a workflow,Struggle / Confusion,"Experiencing issues with simplicity and maintainability in workflows, leading to confusion and complexity."
Reddit,"Sheets scale fine for most n8n use cases if you're using them correctly. I like baserow as I can self host it and the nodes are very easy to use.

Reddit,"I work at n8n and just want to call out that the first “insight” is already kind of BS (about not having error handling):
- Any workflow in n8n can trigger an error workflow. This is set in the workflow’s settings.
- You do need an error trigger in that error workflow, but I know many many users that have 1x fallback error workflow for their entire instance (and each workflow is set to use that flow as error flow). 
- A template when being imported naturally doesn’t import that workflow setting, since it needs to specify a workflow that already exists on your instance.

I did not read the other insights, but saw many comments here about “oh no they’re no prod ready” and it’s due to false AI assumptions from Claude.

As we’re growing, we’re seeing lots of people jump on the bandwagon and share insights. Perhaps there’s some valuable things in OP thread, but when very first thing is totally wrong… it’s hard to trust.

Reddit,This is impressive. But I'm surprised how much code blocks there are - couldn't the agent handle that with the right prompting?,Negative Feedback,"Surprised by the amount of code blocks in n8n workflows, suggesting it could be improved with better prompting capabilities."
Reddit,"It takes between 20 to 45 seconds depending on which path the message takes through the workflow. The longest response time comes from the booking agent path since it needs to make 4 different API calls, including the quoting API which alone takes about 10 seconds. I initially had Mem0Tool for memory management, but it was adding significant overhead, so I'm considering removing it since the PostgreSQL storage works well enough.

Response times occasionally exceeded a minute initially. I managed to dramatically improve this by hosting Supabase locally - some vector queries that were inexplicably slow are now lightning fast. In the end I don’t need it to answer too fast, it wouldn’t feel natural anyway. 

The main bottlenecks I had to solve were:


1. Message batching: Rather than implementing an artificial delay, I leverage the natural processing time (20+ seconds) to my advantage. Just before sending a response, the system checks if any new messages arrived during processing. This prevents duplicate responses when users send multiple consecutive messages without adding extra wait time.

2. Accurate data extraction: Getting reliable booking information (number of adults/children, precise check-in/checkout dates) was challenging. I had to use a specialized extraction agent with careful prompt engineering.

3. Date format interpretation: One surprising challenge was getting the LLM to consistently understand availability dates. Simply feeding ISO dates (yyyy-MM-dd to yyyy-MM-dd) produced inconsistent results. I had to find a more robust format with explicit natural language explanations of each date range. This would probably be less of an issue with a reasoning model, but GPT-4o struggles with it.

4. Context management: n8n's built-in memory nodes proved inadequate for a complex multi-agent system. They created a mess of message attribution - human messages would get processed by one agent, then fed to the next AI node which would incorrectly flag them as AI messages (and vice versa). This created duplicate entries and conversation history chaos. I solved this by implementing my own PostgreSQL-based chat history system with proper chronological ordering. This gives each agent a clean, accurate view of the conversation history without any attribution problems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Struggle / Confusion,"Challenges with response times, message batching, accurate data extraction, date format interpretation, and context management in the n8n system."
Reddit,I used to use pre-determined flow inside Sendpulse but doing it in n8n is easier and more flexible so I don't use their chatbot flow builder anymore.

Reddit,"Yep. The reason you have to install the repo manually on your VPS is because the Mem0 MCP server doesn’t support npx yet.

With some other MCPs, you can just run them with a single npx command. But Mem0’s hasn’t been pushed to npm, so there’s no shortcut. You’ve gotta clone the repo and run it yourself on a server or VPS.

Kinda annoying, but once it’s up, it works fine.",Negative Feedback,The necessity to manually install the repo on their VPS is annoying due to lack of support for npx with Mem0 MCP server.
Reddit,"It is not about being scared it is the fact I have 8 years of B2B marketing and sales using various forms of digital marketing and learning how to use AI workflows are apart of that.

Reddit,"Speaking at someone who works at SaaS companies and is involved with contract stuff, this is typical IN CONCEPT. Almost every service has some language to this effect that your data may be used to improve their platform. Now the language differs and some are more specific as to what sort of data and what sort of usage.

But here's a way to think about it: Say you upload a CSV file to n8n and doesn't process properly. Without this language they basically cannot debug it unless you file a bug, send the the document, and say ""please fix"". With this language they can take your document, figure out exactly what the issue is, patch the code, toss your document and move on with their lives. It also allows them to do this like aggregating data about your workflows and other workflows to figure out whats popular, what's not, whats working, what isn't.

And to be clear, I'd wager that n8n doesn't care about ""your data"" being your files and shit. They care about your workflows. If you build some cool workflow, they want rights to be able to show that off, demo it, learn from it, use it as marketing material, etc. 

At the end of the day, you need to trust your SaaS provider with your data. Regardless of what their contract says, they've got your data. So they can tell you they are using it ""legally"", or they can just use it. You have basically no way of knowing if they are abusing your data or not. If you do not trust the SaaS Vendor, don't give them any data.
